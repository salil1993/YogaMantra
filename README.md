# Credits

Corona Tracker has been developed by me (Paras Sidhu) with the purpose that society remains informed about the corona cases and can get helpful tips from WHO which are shown in main banner.

To make it better on the developer end, I tried using best practices as mentioned above.

Special thanks to the guys at https://www.covid19india.org and their volunteers for providing state-wise data.
